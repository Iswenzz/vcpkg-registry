A repository for managing vcpkg ports of my libraries as well as dependencies not yet included in vcpkg. It provides a convenient way to distribute and use these ports within your development environment when working with the [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) package manager.

## Instructions
Configure your **vcpkg-configuration.json** file.

```json
{
    "default-registry": {
        "kind": "git",
        "repository": "https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg",
        "baseline": "4a600e9fea71bd7872080cbb716797e04d30e6d3"
    },
    "registries": [
        {
            "kind": "git",
            "repository": "https://github.com/Iswenzz/vcpkg-registry",
            "packages": ["ADD_PACKAGES_HERE"],
            "baseline": "c12eb749ee43da80e9951717c334059a50bbdf5b"
